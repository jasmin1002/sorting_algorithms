# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
**Note:** The Big O Notation for this project is only concerned about Time Complexity of a given sorting algorithm.
Space Complexity is not really focused on.

# Learning Objectives:
	* At least four different sorting algorithms
	* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	* What is a stable sorting algorithm


## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. Bubble sort:**
	* [0-bubble_sort.c](./0-bubble_sort.c): a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm
	* [0-O](./0-O): the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

* **1. Insertion sort:**
	* [1-insertion_sort_list.c](./1-insertion_sort_list.c): a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm
	* [1-O](./1-O):  the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

* **2. Selection sort:**
	* [2-selection_sort.c](./2-selection_sort.c): a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm
	* [2-O](./2-O): the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

* **3. Quick sort:**
	* [3-quick_sort.c](./3-quick_sort.c): a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm
	* [3-O](./3-O): the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case
