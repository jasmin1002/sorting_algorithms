# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
**Note:** The Big O Notation for this project is only concerned about Time Complexity of a given sorting algorithm.
Space Complexity is not really focused on.

# Learning Objectives:
	* At least four different sorting algorithms
	* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	* What is a stable sorting algorithm
