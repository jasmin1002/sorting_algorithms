# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
**Note:** The Big O Notation for this project is only concerned about Time Complexity of a given sorting algorithm.
Space Complexity is not really focused on.

# Learning Objectives:
	* At least four different sorting algorithms
	* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	* What is a stable sorting algorithm


## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. Bubble sort:**
	* [0-bubble_sort.c](./0-bubble_sort.c): a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm
